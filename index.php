    <h3><strong>Six Things to Know About IR Questions:&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<ol>
    <li>You must answer all parts of a single question correctly to receive credit. No partial credit is given.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>All answer choices for a single question are presented on the same screen. </li>
    <li>You must submit responses to all parts of the question before moving on to a new question on another screen. </li>
    <li>Once you answer a question, you may not go back and change the answer. </li>
    <li>Answer options for one question will not help you solve other questions. </li>
    <li>You may see several questions for one set of data.

Here are four samples, each representing one type of question: </li>
